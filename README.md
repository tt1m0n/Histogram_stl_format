1. The application allows to load the STL model (only ASCII Format).
2. Calculate and give an opportunity to visualize the histogram of the orientation of the triangles.
3. what means the histogram of the orientation of the triangles:
    Histogram of the total area of triangles from the angle of orientation of the normal with respect to the plane XY. 
    A normal   is a vector perpendicular to the plane of the triangle.

Dependencies:
- Python 2.7
- library matplotlib

1. Clone project
2. print "make"
3. ./view \<filename\>
4. if no errors print "python viz.py"
